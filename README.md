This paper applies a statistical arbitrage algorithm on the U.S. equities index, Standard and Poor's 500, with daily historical prices, from January 2010 to December 2019. The algorithm constructs a portfolio that trades stocks matched into pairs using a wild bootstrap co-integration approach. The empirical results from the algorithm show that the strategy yields an annualised return of 1.17 per cent and a Sharpe Ratio of 1.10. Our findings corroborate previous literature on the topic of modest returns for the strategy compared to a benchmark index. However, the pairs trading portfolio exhibits less volatility, as the risk-adjusted returns are greater.
